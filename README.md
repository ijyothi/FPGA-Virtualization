# FPGA-Virtualization
This project demonstrates how to run the L4Re microkernel (Fiasco.OC) on the Xilinx Zynq (Zybo) board, leveraging the ARM Cortex-A9 Processing System (PS) and integrating with the Programmable Logic (PL). The setup includes booting from an SD card and configuring L4Re to manage virtual machines (VMs) on the Zybo platform.
